      . key elements
          a. Introduce Change
          b. Temporatry, it has a defined beginning and end
          c. Cross-Functional
          d. Deals with the Unknown
          e. Unique
          all of them vary in size/time/budget
      . why organisations use them
          a. Allows them to deliver change in a structured and formal manner
          b. Effective and Effcient management of organisztions limited resources
          c. Establish ownership and accoutability - process and benefits
          d. Provide clarity and agreement across what will be done, when, who, why and the outcomes
          
  - Understand the foundational components of Project Management
      . Planning
      . delegating
      . monitoring
      . controlling
      . motivating those invloded to finish within the expected targets for time, cose, quality, scope, benefits and risks.

  - Unserstand the Project Initialization process, Business case structure and why organizations use them
      . Analyze Case Study (business needs)
      . Analyze Constraints (scope, time, cost)
      . Develop Business Case (cost verses benefits) !!!!!!!!!!! key !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          - The purpose of the Business Case is to establish mechanisms to judge whether the project is (and remains)
            desirable, viable, achievable as a means to support decision making in its initial and continued investment.
      . Develop Project Charter (stakeholders analysis)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Management Plan and SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)

  - Understand what a Process is and its relevance to Project Management
      . A process is a series of progressive and interdependent steps by which an end is attained.
          a. Project Management is a process as it defines a series of tasks (Planning, executing, controlling) to
             deliver a specific / agreed outcome.
          b. SDLCs which are an element of Software Engineering, are a process as they define a set of actions to
             deliver a system / product.
  - Understand what a Project Management Plan (PMP) is and when it is used
      . A PMP is a formal approved document that defines how the project is execued, monitored and controlled.
        It is a document that is owned, controlled and populated by the project Manager and is used throught
        the project. A good PMP provides the required level of details across key project components and is the one
        source of truth for all parties involved across the project.

                . Team uses Product Owner priority to guide the work
                . High-level design is considered
            - Daily Stand-up
                . Whole world is invited, but only team members, scrum masters, product owner can talk.
                . Helps avoids other unnecssary meetings. (15 mins)
                . 3 key questions asked:
                    1. What did I do yesterday
                    2. What will I do today
                    3. What is in my way to get my work completed
            - Sprint Reviews
                . Team presents what it accomplished during the sprint
                . Typically takes the form of a demo of new features or underlying archietecture

            - Sprint backlog
                . Scrum team decompose F_US to Low Level User Stories (L_US) during sprint planning
                . Developers update L_US with the tasks and hours estimates, "Just in Time"
                . User Stories are estimated in Story Points, remaning items are updated daily
                . Sprint backlog is seldom altered
                . User Stories are either not done or 100% completed
            - Burndown charts
                . It is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time
                . It is used to predict when all of the work will be completed

            - Can be very demanding (from traditional approaches) on users time
            - Harder for new starters to intergrate into the team
            - Agile is a very different appraoch - It can be intense for the team

    - Understand how to develop project schedule
        - It contains:
            1. Tasks that need to be completed
                . Break down the tasks into small chunks you can deal with - (WBS)
            2. Duration and dependencies for each task
